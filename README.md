## OpenGLStarter

This is the base code that I'm implementing CG algorithms though OpenGL.

There is a WIP documentation at the [docs](docs/index.md) folder.

## How to Clone?

This library uses git submodules.

You need to fetch the repo and the submodules also.

### a) Clone With Single Command

__HTTPS__

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/A-Ribeiro/OpenGLStarter.git
```

__SSH__

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:A-Ribeiro/OpenGLStarter.git
```

### b) Clone With Multiple Commands

__HTTPS__

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-Ribeiro/OpenGLStarter.git
cd OpenGLStarter
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

__SSH__

```bash
git clone git@github.com:A-Ribeiro/OpenGLStarter.git
cd OpenGLStarter
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
